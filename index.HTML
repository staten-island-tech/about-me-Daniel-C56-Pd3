    <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Dong.  I am a student at Staten Island Technical High School. It's nice to meet you. I want to pursue a career as a surgeon in the Medical field. I have been involved in a 3D printing club and am a tutor for students in junior highschool. I have developed skills in public speaking, leadership, and can adaptance to a situation quickly. I also volunteer at UA3 where we do food pantries helping those less fortunate. I took a summer class at CCNY Stem Institute during the summer where I can do research on a topic that interests me.</p>
